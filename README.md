# GoogleTestPractice

This repository contains a C++ console application developed by other students, with logic testing implemented using the Google Test framework by me.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to write unit tests for the given application to validate input logic such as email validation, username checks, and type input verification using the GoogleTest framework.

## Testing Framework

I used [Google Test (GTest)](https://github.com/google/googletest), a popular and lightweight C++ unit testing framework. It supports a clear syntax using macros like `TEST()`, `EXPECT_EQ()`, and `EXPECT_TRUE()` for efficient and readable test cases.

A total of **16 unit tests** were created covering:

- **Email validation**
- **Username uniqueness**
- **Type input verification**
- **Loop control**
- **Regex validation**

## Result Summary

All implemented tests passed, covering both valid and invalid scenarios to ensure complete branch and decision coverage.
